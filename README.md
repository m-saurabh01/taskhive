# TaskHive: Real-Time Collaborative Task Management Platform

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a scalable, real-time task management platform that facilitates collaboration among users. The platform leverages modern technologies such as microservices, Kafka, Redis, and SQL/NoSQL databases to provide a robust and efficient solution for real-time task collaboration and management.

## Key Features

- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple users can edit and view tasks simultaneously.
- **Task management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks efficiently.
- **Role-based access control**: Different user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) with corresponding permissions.
- **Microservices architecture**: Decoupled services for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Kafka event streaming**: Real-time messaging for updates and notifications.
- **Redis caching**: Improved performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- **SQL/NoSQL databases**: Storage for structured and unstructured data.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: 
  - SQL: PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured data
  - NoSQL: MongoDB/Cassandra for unstructured data
- **Messaging**: Kafka
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Optional**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
  - Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
