# TaskHive : Real-Time Collaborative Task Management Platform

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a scalable, real-time task management platform that facilitates collaboration among users. The platform leverages modern technologies such as microservices, Kafka, Redis, and SQL/NoSQL databases to provide a robust and efficient solution for real-time task collaboration and management.

## Key Features

- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple users can edit and view tasks simultaneously.
- **Task management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks efficiently.
- **Role-based access control**: Different user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) with corresponding permissions.
- **Microservices architecture**: Decoupled services for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Kafka event streaming**: Real-time messaging for updates and notifications.
- **Redis caching**: Improved performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- **SQL/NoSQL databases**: Storage for structured and unstructured data.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: 
  - SQL: PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured data
  - NoSQL: MongoDB/Cassandra for unstructured data
- **Messaging**: Kafka
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Optional**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
  - Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Frontend**: Node.js and npm installed.
- **Backend**: Java 23 and Gradle installed.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL/MySQL and MongoDB/Cassandra installed locally or on a cloud instance.
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka running.
- **Cache**: Redis installed locally or running as a container.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd project-root
```

### Install Dependencies

For the **Frontend**:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

For the **Backend**:

```bash
cd backend
./gradlew build
```

### Running the Application

To start the **Frontend**:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

To start the **Backend**:

```bash
cd backend
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Optional: Running with Docker

If you have Docker installed and want to run the application using containers, use the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Optional: Running with Kubernetes

To deploy on a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the provided YAML manifests in the `kubernetes/` folder.

## Development Notes

- **Service Discovery**: Consider using a service discovery mechanism like Eureka or Consul for dynamic service registration and discovery.
- **Kafka Setup**: Set up Kafka clusters and configure topics for different use cases (e.g., task updates, notifications).
- **Redis Caching**: Configure Redis instances and implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, task data).
- **Database Schema**: Create database schemas for task management, user roles, and collaboration. Initial data population can be done using migration tools like Flyway or Liquibase.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization using Spring Security.

## Environment Variables

Use environment variables for sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and configuration settings. A `.env` file can be used for local development.

```env
# Example .env file
DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/taskdb
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Testing

- **Frontend**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.
- **Backend**: Use JUnit and Mockito for unit testing, and Postman/Newman for API testing.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Cypress or Selenium for automated end-to-end tests.

## Future Enhancements

- **Third-party Integrations**: Add integration with tools like Jira, Trello, or Slack.
- **Analytics**: Implement advanced analytics for task completion rates, user activity, and project progress.
- **Mobile App**: Create a mobile app version for task management on the go.
  
## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Documentation

Provide clear documentation for other developers to understand and contribute to the project:

1. **API Documentation**: Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
2. **Contribution Guidelines**: Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines on how to contribute to the project.
3. **Deployment Guide**: Add instructions for deploying the application on different environments (local, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud).
